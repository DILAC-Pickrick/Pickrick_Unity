# Pickrick Unity
We are exploring Augmented Reality as a way of making history visible in a location-based installation that recreates events that happened over 8 months in the 1960s, on a site that is now part of the Georgia Tech campus.

On July 3 1964, the day after the Civil Rights Act was passed, George Willis, Jr, Albert L. Dunn, and Woodrow T. Lewis, all ministers and students at the Interdenominational Theological Center in Atlanta, attempted to gain entry to the Pickrick restaurant a notorious bastion of resistance to integration. The events of that day became the basis of the first lawsuit brought under that Act, filed by the legendary Constance Baker Motley of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.
